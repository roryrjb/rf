# NAME

rfconfig - configure rf behaviour

$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rf/config

# DESCRIPTION

The config file format is very simple. Comments are only available for a whole
line and start with #. Any lines that begin with a space are ignored.
Each valid config line consists of a key value pair with the key and value
separated by an = character and optionally a single space either side.
Additional spaces will become part of either the key and/or value.

	Match whole path (value "true" or "false")

*limit*
	Limit amount of results (value: a positive integer)
