==========================

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/reb7dt6x7jdn1700/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/qmfrederik/getopt/branch/master)

This repository contains a port of getopt which can be used with Visual C++. It is intended to be used with vcpkg.

The Visual C++ port was originally done by Ludvik Jerabek, and described in the [Full getopt Port for Unicode and Multibyte Microsoft Visual C, C++, or MFC Projects](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/157001/Full-getopt-Port-for-Unicode-and-Multibyte-Microso/)
article. This repository contains a copy of that code and the article.
